# Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project and make it better, your help 
is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about 
social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and 
how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the 
noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/equinor/pysand/issues with the 
label "bug". Please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your Python environment.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Propose New Features

The best way to send feedback is to open an issue at
https://github.com/equinor/pysand/issues with the label "enhancement".
If you are proposing a new feature:

* Explain in detail how it should work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.

### Implement Features

Look through the Git issues for feature requests.
Anything tagged with "enhancement" is open to whoever wants to
implement it.

### Add or Improve Examples
Writing new code is not the only way to get involved and
contribute. Creating examples and/or improving the existing ones is 
very much encouraged.
